		<ul data-role="listview">
			<li data-role="list-divider" data-theme="e">Summarized from official PDGA rules</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Tee-Off</li>
			<li>Must be completely on/in tee pad/area at point of release.</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Marking the Lie</li>
			<li>Mark the spot a throw came to rest with another disc or a designated 
				marker</li>
			<li>If the thrown disc breaks and comes to rest in more than one piece, 
				the largest piece, as agreed to by a majority of the group or an official, 
				is deemed to be the thrown disc.</li>
			<li>A disc thrown in water shall be deemed to be at rest once it is 
				floating or is moving only by the action of the water or the wind on the 
				water.</li>
			<li>If a disc comes to rest above the playing surface in a tree or other 
				object on the course, its lie shall be marked on the playing surface 
				directly below it, or behind that in the line of play if needed.</li>
			<li>If a disc comes to rest below the playing surface its lie shall be 
				marked on the playing surface directly above it</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Other Throws</li>
			<li>Stand just behind marked spot</li>
			<li>Stand in line with marked spot and basket.</li>
			<li>Stepping past the mark is permitted after the disc is released, except 
				when putting within 10 meters.</li>
			<li>If an obstacle blocks your stance, take a stance behind it in the line 
				of play</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Obstacles and Relief</li>
			<li>Once a legal stance is taken, the player may not move an obstacle in 
				any way in order to make room for a throwing motion.</li>
			<li>It is legal for a player's throwing motion to cause incidental 
				movement of an obstacle.</li>
			<li>Purposely damaging anything on the course merits two penalty throws. 
				(don't be a jerk!)</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Optional Rethrow</li>
			<li>At any time, a player may elect to rethrow from the previous lie as 
				evidenced by the marker disc or, if the marker disc has been moved, from 
				an approximate lie as agreed to by the majority of the group or an 
				official. The original throw plus one penalty throw are counted in the 
				player's score.</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Interference</li>
			<li>A disc that hits another player, spectator, or animal shall be played 
				where it comes to rest.</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Out-of-Bounds</li>
			<li>A disc shall be considered out-of-bounds only when it comes to rest 
				and it is clearly and completely surrounded by the out-of-bounds area</li>
			<li>A player whose disc is considered out-of-bounds shall receive one 
				penalty throw. The player may elect to play the next shot from:
				<ol>
					<li>The previous lie</li>
					<li>A lie that is up to one meter away from and perpendicular to the 
						point where the disc last crossed into out-of-bounds, as determined 
						by a majority of the group or an official. This holds true even if 
						the direction takes the lie closer to the hole;</li>
					<li>Within the designated Drop Zone, if provided.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>The Rule of Verticality. The out-of-bounds line represents a vertical 
				plane</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Lost Disc</li>
			<li>A disc shall be declared lost if the player cannot locate it within 
				three minutes after arriving at the spot where it was last seen by the 
				group or an official.</li>
			<li>A player whose disc is declared lost shall receive one penalty throw. 
				If the throw was made from the tee, the player will re-tee for the next 
				shot. If not made from the tee, the group will determine the approximate 
				lie from which the throw was made, and the player will throw again from 
				that lie</li>
