			<li data-role="list-divider">Marking the Lie</li>
			<li>If the thrown disc breaks and comes to rest in more than one piece, the largest piece, as
agreed to by a majority of the group or an official, is deemed to be the thrown disc.</li>
			<li>A disc thrown in water shall be deemed to be at rest once it is floating or is moving only
by the action of the water or the wind on the water.</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Other Throws</li>
			<li>Stand just behing marked spot</li>
			<li>Stand in line with marker and basket.</li>
			<li>Stepping past the mark is permitted after the disc is released, except when
putting within 10 meters.</li>
			<li>If an obstacle blocks your stance, take a stance behind it in the line of play</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Obstacles and Relief</li>
			<li>Once a legal stance is taken, the player may not move an obstacle in any way in order to make room for a throwing motion.</li>
			<li>It is legal for a player's throwing motion to cause incidental movement of an obstacle.</li>
			<li>Purposely damaging anything on the course merits two penalty throws. (don't be a jerk!)</li>
			<li data-role="list-divider">Optional Rethrow</li>
			<li>At any time, a player may elect to rethrow from the previous lie as evidenced by the marker disc or, if the marker disc has been moved, from an approximate lie as agreed to by the majority of the group or an official. The original throw plus one penalty throw are counted in the player's score.</li>
